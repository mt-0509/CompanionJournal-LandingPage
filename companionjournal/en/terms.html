        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) set forth the conditions for using “Companion Journal” (the “Service”), provided by the Companion Journal Operating Team (the “Operator”). Anyone who uses the Service (a “User”) is deemed to have agreed to these Terms.

        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          These Terms apply to all relationships between the User and the Operator in connection with the use of the Service. The Operator may establish various rules, guidelines, and other provisions related to the Service in addition to these Terms (collectively, “Individual Provisions”). Regardless of their name, Individual Provisions form a part of these Terms.
